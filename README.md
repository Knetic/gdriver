# gdriver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Knetic/gdriver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Knetic/gdriver)

Allows shell control of Google Drive.

## Usage

It's strongly recommended that you go to the "releases" page and download
one of the packages or binaries there.

Once installed, you'll want to create a file in "~/.oauth/oauth.json", and
paste in the relevant OAuth configuration information.

## Future

This project doesn't aim to be a complete wrapper around the Google Drive API,
only the parts required to make a periodic backup system (which was my purpose).
I'm not against forks or pull requests for new features, but I myself will probably not
contribute to this to do more than very basic list/pull/push commands.
